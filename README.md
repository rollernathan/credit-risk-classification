## Overview of the Analysis

I was asked to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. In the analysis, I was asked to predict loan_status. A value of 0 for loan_status means the loan is healthy, while a value of 1 means the loan has a high risk of defaulting.

In completing the analysis, I broke the data into labels, loan_status, and features, all data other than loan_status. Then, from those datasets, I created training and testing datasets. After breaking up the dataset, I took the training datasets and used LogisticRegression to create a model to correctly predict the labels based on the features provided. Next, I applied the model to the testing datasets and used the features to predict the labels for the testing dataset. Finally, I created a confusion matrix and classification report to determine how well the model correctly predicts the labels for the testing dataset.


## Results

The testing of the model yielded the following results. Note: analysis is resulted to 2 decimal places.
- When checking how the model did at predicting healthy loans, the results are:
  - Accuracy Score:    100 %
  - Precision Score:   100 %
  - Recall Score:      100 %
 
- When checking how the model did at predicting high risk loans, the results are:
  - Accuracy Score:     91 %
  - Precision Score:    87 %
  - Recall Score:       95 %

## Summary

The logistic regression model does an excellent job predicting healthy loans, with accuracy, precision, and recall of 100 %. This means you can rely on the model to accurately predict a healthy loan for someone who deserves a healthy loan. This is quite promising for the model.

When exploring how well the model does the inverse, predicting if a loan is high-risk, the model still does a good job, but is not quite 100 %. The accuracy score of 91 % is driven mostly by the 87 % precision caused by false positives. This indicates a loan is high-risk, when it is actually healthy. This is better than a false negative indicating a loan is healthy, when it is actually high-risk.

Based on this information, I would recommend the logistic regression model used with only 5 % of loans predicted as healthy when the loan is actually high-risk. I would suggest looking more closely at what features might specifically be causing those results.

Additionally, if provided more funding, I would perform additional analysis using SVM, decision trees, or random forests to fine tune the model and provide more accurate results.
